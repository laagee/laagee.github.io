# exploring ecosystems from roots to space

<font size="4">
The ways ecosystems respond to their environment is the amalgamation of processes that occur across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Interactions between physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms create a nuanced landscape that invites questions from a broad disciplinary base. Our understanding of these processes and how they will respond to changing environmental conditions is at its best when we cultivate and integrate a diverse set of ideas and voices. __*My scientific philosophy centers around promoting integration and inclusion of methods, disciplines, and voices, while striving to celebrate the individuality of each.*__

**about me:**  
</font>
<font size="4">
I am a broadly trained ecohydrologist with research interests in ecosystem modeling, below-ground processes (#roots), data-model integration, and understanding how forests will respond to global change. I use a wide range of tools to address my research questions including empirical data collection, computational models, and remotely sensed observations.

I am currently working with the [Department of Energy's Office of Scientific and Technical Information](https://www.osti.gov) helping support the mission of collecting, preserving, and disseminating federally funded research.
